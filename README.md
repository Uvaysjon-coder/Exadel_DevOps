1. Create a new github repository. You'll need it in the next tasks.

2. Situation: Your PC is connected to your router (with access to the Internet) via
WIFI. And you realize that your PC doesn't have SSH access to your server on
the Internet. Please describe all steps for troubleshooting this issue in the order of your
checking. Add this list of steps as plain text in a new file and push it to your github
repository.

3. Write a script for saving a list of all active OS processes sorted by PID to another
new file. You may use any scripting language (bash/PS/another one...) for it.
Add the resulting file and the script file to your github repository
